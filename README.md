# Odd or Even Game

**A simple Python game where the player guesses if a randomly generated number is odd or even.**

This is a fun beginner-level Python project that generates a random number and asks the player to guess if it's odd or even. The game tells the player if they guessed correctly or not, providing a great way to practice basic Python concepts.

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is asked to guess if the number is **odd** or **even**.
3. After entering the guess, the program will reveal whether the player was correct or not.
4. The game ends after the player makes a guess, but you can restart it to play again.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: The game is written in Python and requires Python 3.x to run.
- **Random module**: This is a built-in Python module used to generate random numbers.

## How to Run the Game

### Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended)

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OddOrEvenGame.git
2. Navigate into the cloned folder:
   **cd OddOrEvenGame**
3. Run the Python script:
   **python odd_or_even_game.py**
If you're using Python 3 specifically, you may need to use:
  **python3 odd_or_even_game.py**
